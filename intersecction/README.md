# Open-Chat-Bot

The chatbot will be featured on [OPEN-Community's website](https://upes-open.org/), where it will provide visitors the necessary information about the OPEN-Community, its mission, and purpose. It would respond to the visitor's questions, help them navigate through the website, inform them about the upcoming events and registration, and would give a short description of each project. It would have set answers to predefined questions and would be able to answer it even if the questions asked slightly resembles the predefined questions.
